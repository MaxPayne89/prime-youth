defmodule KlassHero.Messaging.Application.UseCases.EnforceRetentionPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Use case for enforcing data retention policy on messaging data.

  This use case:
  1. Collects S3 attachment URLs for expired conversations (before DB deletion)
  2. Deletes all messages from conversations that have exceeded their retention period
  3. Deletes the expired conversations themselves (cascade-deletes attachment records)
  4. Cleans up S3 files for the deleted attachments
  5. Publishes a retention_enforced event

  The S3 cleanup must happen AFTER the transaction succeeds, because the attachment
  records are cascade-deleted when messages are removed. We collect URLs before the
  transaction so we don't lose the file references.

  Typically run by a background worker (Oban) on a daily schedule after
  the archive worker has run.
