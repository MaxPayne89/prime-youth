  Use case for assigning a staff member to a program.

  Persists the assignment and publishes a domain event so that
  downstream contexts (e.g., Messaging) can react via integration events.

  - `{:ok, ProgramStaffAssignment.t()}` — assignment created successfully
  - `{:error, :already_assigned}` — the staff member is already assigned to this program
  - `{:error, :not_found}` — the staff member does not exist
