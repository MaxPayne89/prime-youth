  Emails a provider's business owner when an incident report is submitted.

  Payload-driven: `business_owner_email` and `business_name` arrive in the
  args map (forwarded by `NotifyIncidentReportedWorker` from the enqueued
  Oban job). No `ProviderProfile` lookup happens here — that responsibility
  is upstream in `SubmitIncidentReport`, which loads the profile once and
  threads the two fields through the scheduler.
