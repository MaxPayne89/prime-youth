defmodule KlassHero.Enrollment.Adapters.Driven.ACL.ProgramScheduleACL do
  @moduledoc """
  ACL adapter that resolves program start dates for eligibility checks.

  The Enrollment context needs to know when a program starts for
  "at program start" eligibility checks (e.g., age at program start).

  ## Why direct DB query instead of ProgramCatalog facade?

  ProgramCatalog already depends on Enrollment (for capacity ACL).
  Adding Enrollment → ProgramCatalog would create a dependency cycle.
  This adapter queries the `programs` table directly — acceptable in
  the adapter layer since it's infrastructure, not domain logic.
