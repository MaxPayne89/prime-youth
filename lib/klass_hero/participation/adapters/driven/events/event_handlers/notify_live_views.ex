defmodule KlassHero.Participation.Adapters.Driven.Events.EventHandlers.NotifyLiveViews do
  @moduledoc """
  Routes Participation domain events to PubSub topics for LiveView real-time updates.

  Publishes each event to two topics:
  1. Generic topic (`participation:event_type`) — for context-wide subscribers
  2. Provider-specific topic (`participation:provider:provider_id`) — for provider-scoped LiveViews

  Provider ID is resolved via the ForResolvingProgramProvider ACL port.
  If resolution fails, the provider-specific publish is skipped (best-effort).

  Provider-specific routing applies only to session and attendance events (which carry
  `program_id` in their payload). Behavioral note events use a different aggregate type
  and carry `provider_id` directly — they skip provider-specific routing and are delivered
  only via the generic topic.
