  Promotes Family domain events to integration events for cross-context communication.

  Registered on the Family DomainEventBus. When a relevant domain event is
  dispatched, this handler creates the corresponding integration event and
  publishes it via PubSub.

  ## Error strategy

  Propagates publish failures — the GDPR anonymization cascade requires
  confirmation that downstream contexts were notified. A publish failure
  halts the reduce_while loop in the Family facade.
