  @moduledoc """
  ACL adapter that cleans up participation data for child deletion.

  Deletes behavioral notes and participation records directly to avoid
  a dependency cycle (Participation already depends on Family).

  Behavioral notes must be deleted before participation records because
  behavioral_notes.child_id has an ON DELETE: nothing FK constraint that
  would block child deletion.
