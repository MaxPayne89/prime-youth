## 📱 How to View App Mockups

**For non-developers:** Want to see how the Prime Youth website will look and work? Follow these simple steps:

### Quick Start (Anyone Can Do This!)

1. **Find the mockup files** in your file manager:
   - Navigate to: `mobile/mockups/`
   - You'll see several HTML files - these are the app previews

2. **Start with the main hub** (recommended first stop):
   - Double-click: `mobile/mockups/index.html`
   - This opens your main menu to access everything

3. **Or jump directly to the app screens**:
   - Double-click: `mobile/mockups/app-mockups.html` 
   - This shows the actual phone screens (Login, Home, Programs, etc.)

### What You'll See

- **📱 App Mockups** - Complete phone screens showing how users will navigate the app
- **🧩 Component Library** - Individual buttons, forms, and UI pieces
- **🎨 Design System** - Colors, animations, and interactive features  
- **🎯 Design Tokens** - The building blocks (colors, fonts, spacing)

### Navigating the Mockups

- **Click the buttons at the top** to switch between different app screens
- **Try the dark/light mode toggle** (🌙/☀️ button) 
- **Everything is clickable** - buttons, links, and interactive elements work
- **Scroll down** to see more content on each screen

### Tips for Best Experience

- **Use a modern browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **Make your browser window bigger** for the best view
- **Try on your phone too** - the mockups work on mobile browsers
- **Nothing will break** - click around and explore freely!
