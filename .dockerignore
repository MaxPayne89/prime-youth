# This file excludes paths from the Docker build context.
#
# By default, Docker's build context includes all files (and folders) in the
# current directory. Even if a file isn't copied into the container, it is
# still sent to the Docker daemon.
#
# There are multiple reasons to exclude files from the build context:
#
# 1. Prevent nested folders from being copied into the container – while loading
#    native code installed outside of the container, packages may have been
#    compiled for the wrong architecture
# 2. Reduce the size of the build context and the final image size
# 3. Prevent sensitive information from leaking into the built image
# 4. Reduce the time it takes to load the context
