# Staff Invitation Saga Design

**Issue:** #492 — Adding a team member automatically sends them a provider registration email
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Draft

## Overview

When a business account adds a staff member via the Team section, the platform automatically sends an invitation email. On completing registration, the staff member gets a `:staff_provider` role — they work under the inviting business's profile (no independent ProviderProfile). The flow is modeled as a choreography-based saga crossing the Provider and Accounts bounded contexts, with idempotency at every step and a compensating event for email delivery failure.

## Architecture: Choreography + Inline Saga State (Approach C)

Saga state lives on the `staff_members` table as `invitation_status`. No separate orchestrator or process manager. Each context reacts to the previous context's integration events. All saga events are **critical** (Oban-backed, idempotent via `processed_events` table).

This mirrors the existing Invite-Claim saga pattern (Enrollment ↔ Family).

A follow-up issue (#496) tracks extracting a reusable `GenStateMachine`-based process manager pattern once more sagas emerge.

## Saga Flow

### Happy Path — New User (no existing account)

```
Provider Context                          Accounts Context
──────────────────                        ──────────────────
Business owner adds staff member (email required for invitation)
  → CreateStaffMember use case
  → Generates invitation token, stores hash on staff_members
  → invitation_status: :pending
  → Emits :staff_member_invited (critical)
    payload includes raw_token for email link construction
                                    ───►
                                          StaffInvitationHandler receives event
                                          → Uses raw_token from payload to build email link
                                          → Sends invitation email via UserNotifier
                                          → Emits :staff_invitation_sent (critical)
                                    ◄───
Provider updates staff_member
  invitation_status: :sent

          ... user clicks link, completes registration ...

                                          Staff invitation registration LiveView
                                          → Registers user (intended_roles: [:staff_provider])
                                          → No ProviderProfile auto-created
                                          → Emits :staff_user_registered (critical)
                                    ◄───
Provider updates staff_member
  user_id: user.id
  invitation_status: :accepted
  → Saga complete
```

### Alternate Path — Existing User (already registered)

```
Provider Context                          Accounts Context
──────────────────                        ──────────────────
Business owner adds staff member
  → invitation_status: :pending
  → Generates token, stores hash
  → Emits :staff_member_invited (critical)
                                    ───►
                                          StaffInvitationHandler receives event
                                          → Checks Accounts.get_user_by_email(email)
                                          → User found! Skips invitation email
                                          → Sends notification email instead
                                          → Emits :staff_user_registered (critical)
                                            payload: {user_id, staff_member_id, provider_id}
                                    ◄───
Provider updates staff_member
  user_id: found_user_id
  invitation_status: :accepted
  → Saga complete (fast path)
```

### Compensation Path — Email Delivery Failure

```
Provider Context                          Accounts Context
──────────────────                        ──────────────────
                                          Email delivery fails
                                          → Emits :staff_invitation_failed (critical)
                                    ◄───
Provider updates staff_member
  invitation_status: :failed
  (compensating event applied)

Business owner sees "Invitation Failed" in Team UI
  → Clicks "Resend Invite"
  → invitation_status transitions :failed → :pending
  → Clears old invitation_token_hash
  → Re-emits :staff_member_invited
  → Saga restarts from beginning (idempotent)
```

## Invitation Status State Machine

```
:pending ──→ :sent ──→ :accepted
    │           │
    │           └──→ :expired (via on-access check in LiveView)
    │
    └──→ :failed ──→ :pending (on resend)
                         ▲
:expired ────────────────┘ (on resend)
```

Implemented as a pure domain function with a transition map on `StaffMember`:

```elixir
@valid_transitions %{
  nil     => [:pending],
  :pending => [:sent, :failed],
  :sent    => [:accepted, :expired],
  :failed  => [:pending],
  :expired => [:pending]
}

def transition_invitation(staff_member, new_status) do
  allowed = Map.get(@valid_transitions, staff_member.invitation_status, [])

  if new_status in allowed do
    {:ok, %{staff_member | invitation_status: new_status}}
  else
    {:error, :invalid_invitation_transition}
  end
end
```

## Idempotency Guarantees

| Step | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| `:staff_member_invited` handled | Critical event + `processed_events` — handler runs exactly once |
| Token generation | Generated by Provider before emitting event — part of the same use case transaction |
| Email send | Idempotent by nature (worst case: duplicate email, not harmful) |
| `:staff_invitation_sent` / `:failed` | Critical event — status update is idempotent (re-setting same status is no-op) |
| `:staff_user_registered` handled | Critical event — linking same user_id twice is no-op |

## Data Model Changes

### Staff Members Table — New Columns

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | `references(:users, type: :binary_id, on_delete: :nilify_all)` | Links staff member to user account once registered/linked |
| `invitation_status` | `string` | Saga state: `pending`, `sent`, `failed`, `accepted`, `expired` |
| `invitation_token_hash` | `binary` | Hashed invitation token for secure lookup |

`on_delete: :nilify_all` preserves the staff member record if the user account is deleted (e.g., GDPR). The link is severed, invitation can be re-triggered.

Token hash lives on `staff_members` (not `user_tokens`) to co-locate saga state. **Provider generates the token and stores the hash** — Accounts never writes to this table. The raw token travels in the `:staff_member_invited` event payload so Accounts can construct the email link. Accounts performs a cross-context read to verify tokens on registration.

### Staff Members Without Email

The `email` field on `staff_members` remains optional. When a staff member is added **without** an email, no invitation saga is triggered — the staff member is a "display-only" team member (visible on program pages, no user account). The `CreateStaffMember` use case only emits `:staff_member_invited` when `email` is present and non-empty. `invitation_status` stays `nil` for staff members without email.

### User Schema — Role Changes

Adding `:staff_provider` requires updates in several places:

- `UserRole` (`accounts/types/user_role.ex`): Add `:staff_provider` to `@valid_roles`, update `valid_roles/0`, type spec `@type t`, and `@role_permissions` map
- `UserRoles` (`accounts/types/user_roles.ex`): No change needed (generic over `UserRole`)
- `User` schema (`accounts/.../schemas/user.ex`): The existing `registration_changeset` validates `intended_roles` against `UserRole.valid_roles()` and conditionally validates `provider_subscription_tier` — once `:staff_provider` is in `valid_roles/0`, it will pass validation. However, a **staff-specific registration changeset** (e.g., `staff_registration_changeset/2`) is needed because:
  - Staff registration doesn't require `provider_subscription_tier` selection
  - Staff registration pre-fills `name` and `email` from the invitation (may not need the same UI validation)
  - The `intended_roles` should be locked to `[:staff_provider]` (not user-selectable)

### Scope Enhancement

```elixir
%Scope{
  user: %User{},
  roles: [:staff_provider],
  parent: nil,
  provider: nil,
  staff_member: %StaffMember{}   # NEW — populated for :staff_provider role
}
```

`Scope.resolve_roles/1` gains a third check:

1. `Family.get_parent_by_identity(user.id)` → if found, add `:parent`
2. `Provider.get_provider_by_identity(user.id)` → if found, add `:provider`
3. `Provider.get_active_staff_member_by_user(user.id)` → if found, add `:staff_provider`, populate `scope.staff_member` (**new public API function** on the `Provider` facade module)

## Event Definitions

### Integration Events (Cross-Context, All Critical)

| Event | Source | Topic | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:staff_member_invited` | Provider | `integration:provider:staff_member_invited` | `{staff_member_id, provider_id, email, first_name, last_name, business_name, raw_token}` |
| `:staff_invitation_sent` | Accounts | `integration:accounts:staff_invitation_sent` | `{staff_member_id, provider_id}` |
| `:staff_invitation_failed` | Accounts | `integration:accounts:staff_invitation_failed` | `{staff_member_id, provider_id, reason}` |
| `:staff_user_registered` | Accounts | `integration:accounts:staff_user_registered` | `{user_id, staff_member_id, provider_id}` |

### Event Factory Modules

New factory functions are needed in:
- `ProviderIntegrationEvents` — `:staff_member_invited`
- `AccountsIntegrationEvents` — `:staff_invitation_sent`, `:staff_invitation_failed`, `:staff_user_registered`

### Existing User Detection

**Accounts performs the lookup, not Provider.** Provider cannot depend on Accounts (Boundary constraint — would create a cycle since Accounts already depends on Provider). Instead, Provider emits `:staff_member_invited` with the staff member's email. The `StaffInvitationHandler` in Accounts checks `Accounts.get_user_by_email/1` to determine whether the email belongs to an existing user, then branches accordingly. No `existing_user_id` in the event payload — detection happens on the Accounts side.

### Registration Hook

The existing `ProviderEventHandler` that listens to `:user_registered` checks `"provider" in intended_roles` (string comparison). When a staff member registers with `intended_roles: [:staff_provider]`, the payload contains `["staff_provider"]` — the handler's check naturally returns false, so **no code change is needed** to skip ProviderProfile creation. The `intended_roles` for staff registration must never include `"provider"` alongside `"staff_provider"`.

## Routing & Role-Based Access

### New Router Scope

```elixir
live_session :require_staff_provider,
  on_mount: [{KlassHeroWeb.UserAuth, :require_staff_provider}] do
  live "/staff/dashboard", StaffDashboardLive, :index
end
```

`UserAuth` gets a `require_staff_provider` mount checking `:staff_provider in @current_scope.roles`.

### Staff Dashboard (Minimal for #492)

A new LiveView at `lib/klass_hero_web/live/staff/staff_dashboard_live.ex`:

- Shows the business name (via `staff_member.provider_id → ProviderProfile`)
- Lists programs matching staff member's `tags` (maps to program categories)
- No team management, billing, or verification docs

Full staff experience (schedule, attendance, messaging) is follow-up work.

## Email Templates

### Staff Invitation Email (new user)

- Function: `UserNotifier.deliver_staff_invitation/3`
- Subject: "You've been invited to join [Business Name] on Klass Hero"
- Body: Brief Klass Hero explanation, who invited them, tokenized registration link
- Link: `/users/staff-invitation/{token}`
- Plain text (consistent with existing emails)

### Staff Notification Email (existing user)

- Function: `UserNotifier.deliver_staff_added_notification/2`
- Subject: "You've been added to [Business Name]'s team on Klass Hero"
- Body: Explains they've been added, links to staff dashboard
- Link: `/staff/dashboard`

## Invitation Registration LiveView

New LiveView at `lib/klass_hero_web/live/user_live/staff_invitation.ex`, route: `/users/staff-invitation/:token`.

**On mount:**
1. Hash token from URL
2. Call `Provider.get_staff_member_by_token_hash/1` (cross-context read via public API)
3. Not found → error page ("invalid or already used invitation")
4. Found but expired (check `updated_at` + 7 days) → transition status to `:expired`, show "invitation expired — ask your business to resend"
5. Found and valid → pre-fill form with `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`

**On submit:**
1. Register via `Accounts.register_user/1` with `intended_roles: [:staff_provider]`
2. Emit `:staff_user_registered` integration event
3. Log in and redirect to `/staff/dashboard`

Lives in `:current_user` live session (no auth required).

## Token Generation

Same pattern as existing magic link tokens, but **generated by Provider context** (not Accounts):

1. `CreateStaffMember` use case generates 32 random bytes → URL-safe base64 encode (raw token)
2. SHA-256 hash → store on `staff_members.invitation_token_hash`
3. Raw token included in `:staff_member_invited` event payload (Accounts uses it to build email link)
4. Verify (cross-context read): Accounts calls `Provider.get_staff_member_by_token_hash/1` (**new public API function** on the Provider facade) — returns the staff member if hash matches and `invitation_status == :sent`, `nil` otherwise
5. Expiry: 7 days from token creation. Checked on-access in the invitation LiveView by comparing `staff_member.updated_at` (or a dedicated `invitation_sent_at` field) against `DateTime.utc_now()`. If expired, the LiveView shows an "invitation expired" message and does **not** render the registration form. The status transition to `:expired` happens at this point (lazy expiry — no scheduled job needed for MVP)

## Resend Flow

1. Business owner clicks "Resend Invite" (visible for `:failed` / `:expired` statuses)
2. `invitation_status` transitions back to `:pending`
3. Old `invitation_token_hash` cleared
4. Re-emits `:staff_member_invited` integration event
5. Saga restarts — fully idempotent

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Provider Context:**
- `StaffMember.transition_invitation/2` — all valid transitions succeed, invalid transitions return error
- `CreateStaffMember` use case — emits `:staff_member_invited`, sets status `:pending`
- Existing user detection — payload includes `existing_user_id` when email matches
- Resend flow — transitions from `:failed`/`:expired` to `:pending`, clears token, re-emits event

**Accounts Context:**
- `StaffInvitationHandler` — happy path: token generated, email sent, `:staff_invitation_sent` emitted
- `StaffInvitationHandler` — failure path: email fails, `:staff_invitation_failed` emitted
- `StaffInvitationHandler` — existing user: notification sent, `:staff_user_registered` emitted immediately
- Token verification — valid token resolves staff member, expired/invalid rejected

**Shared:**
- Idempotency — each handler processes same event only once

### Integration Tests

**Full saga — new user:**
1. Create staff member → `:staff_member_invited` emitted
2. Handler processes → token created, email sent, `:staff_invitation_sent` emitted
3. Provider updates status to `:sent`
4. Register via token → user created with `:staff_provider` role
5. `:staff_user_registered` emitted → staff member linked, status `:accepted`
6. No ProviderProfile created

**Full saga — existing user:**
1. Create staff member with existing user's email → `existing_user_id` in payload
2. Handler sends notification, emits `:staff_user_registered`
3. Staff member linked immediately, status `:accepted`

**Compensation:**
1. Create staff member → email delivery fails
2. `:staff_invitation_failed` → status `:failed`
3. Resend → saga restarts from `:pending`

### LiveView Tests

**Staff Invitation Registration:**
- Valid token → form with pre-filled fields
- Expired token → error message
- Invalid token → error message
- Successful registration → redirect to `/staff/dashboard`

**Staff Dashboard:**
- Staff provider sees business name and assigned programs
- Programs filtered by staff member's tags

**Provider Team UI:**
- "Resend Invite" visible for `:failed` / `:expired`
- Invitation status displayed per staff member
